# Automated Fault Detection in Aircraft Maintenance Logs

### 1. Problem
Aircraft maintenance logs play a critical role in tracking service history and anticipating potential failures. Traditionally, these logs are reviewed manually after each flightâ€”a necessary process for ensuring safety and compliance, but one that adds significant time, labor, and cost to operations.

### 2. Goal
To address these challenges, a machine learning-based detection and recommendation system designed to automate fault identification and suggest maintenance actions could be novel. This system aims to reduce downtime, minimize manual review effort, and enhance overall aircraft readiness and operational efficiency.

### 3. Action

#### Data Preprocess
* Ingest raw maintenance logs and associated metadata

* Clean Logs by desired performitive maintenance indicators (e.g., "replace", "failed", "leaking", "degraded").

* Possibly label logs into actionable categories (e.g., no issue, repair required, replacement suggested).

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**                     | Transformer-based Deep Learning                        | Instance-based Machine Learning                        |
| **Best For**                 | Text with complex context (e.g., maintenance logs)     | Simple structured data or as a baseline                |
| **Text Understanding**       | High (context-aware word embeddings)                   | Low (token overlap or fixed embeddings)                |
| **Training Time**            | High (fine-tuning required)                            | None (lazy learner)                                    |
| **Inference Speed**          | Fast after training                                    | Slow (needs to compare to all samples at runtime)      |
| **Scalability**              | Good with large data (with GPU)                        | Poor with large datasets                               |
| **Accuracy (Text Tasks)**    | High                                                   | Moderate to low                                        |
| **Explainability**           | Harder (can use SHAP/LIME)                             | Easy (based on nearest neighbors)                      |
| **Ease of Implementation**   | Moderate (requires model loading/tokenization)         | Very easy (with scikit-learn)                          |
| **NLP Task Suitability**     | Excellent                                              | Weak                                                   |

ircraft maintenance logs are often unstructured and unlabeled, making them difficult to process with traditional models like KNN. 

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a self-supervised, transformer-based model that excels at understanding context in natural language. It can be fine-tuned on small labeled datasets and still perform well, making it ideal for extracting issues from raw maintenance notes.

While **KNN** is easy to implement and useful as a baseline, it lacks deep contextual understanding and doesn't scale well with large text data.

BERT offers significantly better performance and flexibility for NLP tasks like fault detection, making it the preferred choice for this application.

#### Model Evaluation

#### Recomendation Layer

* Map faults to a database of corrective actions needed to be taken to solve the issue.
